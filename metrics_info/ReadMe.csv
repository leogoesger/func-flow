File Outputs,,,
Annual flow matrix,"Output CSV provides daily flow organized by water year. The first flow value of the column is on the start date of the water year (e.g., Oct. 1). In leap years, columns have 366 flow values. In all other water years, columns have 365 values and there is a NA value in the final row. ",,
Annual metric results,"Output CSV provides FFC metric results calculated for every water year of uploaded flow timeseries. If a water year within the period of record has above 100 NA values or 270 zero flow values, metrics will not be calculated for that water year. Descriptions of the results are included below, and more detailed description can be found in the eFlows documentation: https://eflows.gitbook.io/project/website_summary",,
Supplementary metrics,"Output CSV provides supplementary flow metrics to complement the 24 functional flow metrics. These are average annual flow, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and dry season no-flow days. ",,
